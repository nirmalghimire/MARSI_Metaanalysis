# MARSI_Metaanalysis
This Python program is designed to analyze and visualize data from two research instruments, SORS (Survey of Reading Strategies) and MARSI (Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory). It loads data from Excel files, cleans and standardizes the data, and then performs various analyses, including descriptive statistics and the creation of graphs to understand the distribution of different variables within the datasets. The program also generates frequency tables and summary statistics for specific columns, providing insights into the research findings related to gender, constructs, teaching/learning, and other relevant aspects.
